### Example 1

**Original User Instruction:**
> I want to be for it to calculate hours, For example if I put it: Sleep 7:34 =....

**Rephrased AI Suggestion:**
> I want the application to calculate time based on an 'HH:MM' (hours and minutes) format. For example, if I enter '7:34' for Sleep, the application should correctly parse this, calculate the weekly total, and update all summaries accordingly.

### Example 2

**Original User Instruction:**
> How do I make the app run in local host, And what how do I say it better in english for the next AI to understand?

**Rephrased AI Suggestion:**
> How can I serve my static web project on a local development server, so it's accessible via a `http://localhost` URL?

### Example 3

**Original User Instruction:**
> Like, fuck me man, but can you make it so that I could just put the hours numbers in the total right? Yeah, I should have kept up very very simple in the first place, but I just fucked up.

**Rephrased AI Suggestion:**
> I want to pivot the app's core logic. The current system of calculating a weekly total from daily averages is too rigid for my inconsistent schedule. Please simplify the application by removing the 'Daily Hours' and 'Days/Week' columns and allowing me to directly input the total weekly hours for each category.
